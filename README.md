Brief project description: 
    This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict student academic performance. Using the "student-mat.csv" dataset, the project explores 
    various factors influencing student outcomes, including grades, demographics, and lifestyle choices. The goal is to develop a model that can predict final grades 
    (G3) and classify students based on their pass/fail status, providing valuable insights for educators and students to identify areas for improvement and 
    intervention.
